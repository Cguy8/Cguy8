Originally developed through remote collaboration in the first half of 2021

This project was originally envisioned as multi-generational, such that future students of the University Honors Program could continue work that was done in previous years. As such, development on the project has coninued following my departure from the Project Manager role. This repository contains only the progress that was made as of the time my work was completed.

The current version of this project, following my involvement, has a live URL at honorsbook.academic.csusb.edu/
