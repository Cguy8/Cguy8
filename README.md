My name is Colby Holloman.
I'm interested in a career in the video game industry.
I'm continuing to hone my skills with C++ and C#, including on the Unity platform.
I'm looking to learn more about develpment on the Unreal Engine.
I can be reached by email at COLBYGUY8@GMAIL.COM

This repository contains various software projects I have developed. Each folder contains its own README file with more details about the project and my involvement with it, including the following:
- Peace of Mind, a proof-of-concept Google Cloud Platform application written primarily in Python.
- HonorsBook, a prototype web application written primarily in HTML and Javascript.
- Cosmic Quest Battle, a 2D game on the Unity engine written primarily in C#.
- Waivern Adventure, a top-down game on the Unity engine written primarily in C#.

Further information about other software projects, such as "Yield," a proof-of-concept Android application written in Java, is available on request.
